# Short notes on tasks
## Part1 (import reports)
- importcsv in reports/tasks to import reports into database
  - it lists all .csv files and iterate the list to import into database
  - it create records from file into database if row/report is not already inserted into db
- to run this script periodic manner, we setup scheduler and worker using celery and rabbitmq
- this script also can be run by manually in above mentioned way
- We also can run this script aschync way from uploader method when file is uploaded if we add feature to upload reports file in this project

## Part2 (views)
### View1
- Percentage View
  - If occurrences of selected date and same day of last week of the selected date are same, it will show progress as 0.0%
  - If occurence of same day of last week of the selected date is 0 or null, it will also show 0.0%
  - Formula to make percentage, here, is ((current-previous)/previous)*100

### View2

## Periodic runner settings
- configuration to make scheduler in reports/settings.py
- it is scheduled to send request to run imporcsv each 5 min. we can do it once in a day, or once in hour etc.. based on needs
